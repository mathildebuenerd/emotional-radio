# Emotional Radio

_Emotional radio_ is a radio that can be controlled with facial expressions.

## Description
Our language shapes the way we describe the world, the way we communicate, and indeed, the way we think. We are all limited by the words provided by our own languages, and even, the words we actually know inside it.

But emotions are universal. _Emotional radio_ is a kind of search engine for music, in which you can navigate using you facial expression.
